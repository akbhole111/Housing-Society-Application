# Housing-Society-Application

Our project is an implementation of a chat forum for society members in Android Studio using Java.

The app consists of a three frames :- 
i) Chat frame 
ii) Call frame 
iii) Status frame 

We have added sign up and sign in pages using Google firebase authenticator. Every activity is created as a separate fragment. Additionally we have the functionality to add profile images in our account.
